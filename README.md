# Protein motif finder

Motifs play a crucial role in protein functions. For example, short linear motifs (SLiMs) are known to mediate proteinâ€“protein interactions. In our research projects, we study protein structures and identifying motifs is integral in understanding protein functional properties. With the recent revolution in the structural biology field, [AlphaFold Database](https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk/) now contains predicted structures of almost all sequences deposed in the proteome database [Uniprot](https://www.uniprot.org/). We can use the AlphaFold predicted structures to investigate motifs of interest on the structural level.

Our project is to create a tool that allows scientists to find and visualize motifs in their proteins of interest to get more insights about their function. 

The program's input will be a UniProt sequence ID and the amino acid sequence of the motif. 
Our program will retrieve the protein sequence and a PDB file with the structure from the AlphaFold database, find the indicated motif, and visualize it using [PyMOL](https://pymol.org/2/).
The output will be a PyMOL session file (.pse) with all proteins and their colored motifs.
